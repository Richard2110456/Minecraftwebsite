        <p>When you first start minecraft you spawn into a world with nothing. You should start with punching a tree to get some wood and make a crafting tavle to craft weapons. Then, you want to find a food source you can kill any animals there or go to a village, mine the hay bales and craft them into bread. They you can building a simple starter home out of whatever materials you have on hand. </p>
        <br>
        <p> The next step is mining. Start by making sure you have food and a weapon (a stone sword typically). Then descend into your nearest cave. First look for coal and iron as those are some of the only things you can mine with stone tools. The second you find 3 iron you should put it in a furnace and the craft the ingots into a pickaxe. This will allow you to mine most blocks in the caves and will allow you to mine the blocks you already could quicker. Then you should mine enough iron for armor and a little extra for when some of it breaks.</p><br>
        <p> Your next step should be diamonds. You have to be under y level 16 and are most common at y level -58. Search around it caves, it my take a while but you will find them. Once you find them make a pixace. The try to find obisidan (or lava if you have a water bucket).Then mine obsidian (at least 14) to craft an nether  portal. Try to find the diamonds for a full set of armor, a weapon and an enchantement table.  </p><br>
